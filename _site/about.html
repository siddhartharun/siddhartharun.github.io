      <p>I'm currently wrapping up my seven year journey as a Product Designer at Meta (2018 → 25). I led design within the Business Platform team for Reality Labs, focusing on building enterprise solutions for Meta Quest / Portal devices. Previously, I led design within the Infrastructure org, focusing primarily on designing and shipping internal tooling centered on developer experiences.</p>

<p>Prior to that, I ran Neutral Inc — a product design & technology studio primarily working exclusively with early stage startups and founders designing and building internet software, websites and mobile apps.</p>
