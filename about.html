<p>I'm currently wrapping up my seven year journey as a Product Designer at Meta (2018 â†’ 25). I led design within the Business Platform team for Reality Labs, focusing on building enterprise solutions for Meta Quest / Portal devices. Previously, I led design within the Infrastructure org, focusing primarily on designing and shipping internal tooling centered on developer experiences.</p>
